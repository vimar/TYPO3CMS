# TYPO3CMS CodeSniffer standard

## Description

This standard consist of a subset of sniffs from the [TYPO3SniffPool](https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3SniffPool) and implements the Coding Guidelines for [TYPO3 CMS](http://typo3.org/). 

It contains just a ruleset.xml file in which we refer to the sniffs from [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and from [TYPO3SniffPool](https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3SniffPool).

## How to get

In case you didn't have installed the [TYPO3SniffPool](https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3SniffPool) or the [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) yet - no problem. This packages are marked as dependencies of this standard and will install automatically.

There are several ways to get the standard, which I am going to describe now. There is no right or wrong. Which way you choose depends on your preferences and at least on your requirements.

### Composer

We support [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), a dependency manager for PHP. 
 
Create a composer.json in the root folder of your project or extend the existing one and declare this package as a dependency:
 
```
{
	"minimum-stability": "alpha",
	"require": {
		"typo3-ci/typo3cms": "dev-master"
	}
}
```

Since the package is managed with [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) this is all what you need.

This will install the [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and the [TYPO3SniffPool](https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3SniffPool) into the *vendor/* folder of your project. For more informations about Composer have a look at their [documentation](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

### Git

The second way is to clone [the repository](https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3CMS) from github. **In this case you have to take care about the dependencies by yourself**.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3CMS.git
$ git clone https://github.com/typo3-ci/TYPO3SniffPool.git
```

## How to use

As various the installations methods are, as various the usage is.

### Composer

Change into your project folder and call the PHP_CodeSniffer from there:

```
$ cd myproject
$ php vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/scripts/phpcs --standard=TYPO3CMS /path/to/folder
```

Its also possible to call this standard with a global installed PHP_CodeSniffer (f.e. via PEAR)

```
$ cd myproject
$ phpcs --standard=vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards/TYPO3CMS/ruleset.xml /path/to/folder
```

### Git

After you cloned the standard and it dependencies the usage is nearly the same as above. There are two main methods. 
 
1. Copy the standard into the *Standards/* folder of the PHP_CodeSniffer and call it with *--standard=TYPO3CMS*

2. Put the standard at any place you want and call point to it absolutely *--standard=/path/to/TYPO3CMS/ruleset.xml*
